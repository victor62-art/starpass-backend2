# Contributing to StarPass Backend

This project participates in the [Stellar Wave Program](https://drips.network/wave/stellar) on Drips. Contributors earn USDC rewards for resolving issues.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL (or Docker)
- npm

## Setup

### Local setup with Docker Compose

Docker Compose starts the PostgreSQL and Redis services expected by the app:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
make docker-up
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run start:dev
```

The default compose services expose PostgreSQL on `localhost:5432`, Redis on
`localhost:6379`, and the API on `localhost:4000`. Stop the local services with:

```bash
make docker-down
```

For test infrastructure only, use:

```bash
make docker-test-up
# run focused tests here
make docker-test-down
```

The test compose file exposes PostgreSQL on `localhost:5433` and Redis on
`localhost:6380` so it can run alongside the development services.

### Manual local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/starpass-backend
cd starpass-backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET in .env
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run start:dev
```

## Workflow

1. Browse open issues and comment to express interest
2. Wait to be assigned before starting work
3. Fork and create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`
4. Make your changes
5. Run checks:

```bash
npm run lint    # ESLint
npm test        # Jest tests
npm run build   # TypeScript build
```

6. Open a Pull Request against `main`
